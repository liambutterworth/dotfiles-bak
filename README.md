# Dotfiles

A collection of configuration files for my dev setup.

## Vim

To get vim up and running you'll need to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) installed then run: ```$ vim
+PlugInstall +qall```

### Custom Keystrokes

Space is setup as the leader key

```_``` exit out to last file inside netrw  

```,,``` toggle , at the end of the line in any mode  

```;;``` toggle ; at the end of the line in any mode  

```<space>s``` sort alphabetically inside {} (useful for css)  

```<space>S``` sort alphabetically inside {} globally  

```<space>a=``` align block by =  

```<space>a:``` align block by : (uses space after : as delimeter)  

```<space>a"``` align block by " (useful for vim-style comments)
